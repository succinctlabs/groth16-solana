# Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `sp1-solana` crate to verify a proof generated by SP1 on Solana.

## Overview: Script

This script will load an SP1 [`SP1ProofWithPublicValues`](https://docs.rs/sp1-sdk/2.0.0/sp1_sdk/proof/struct.SP1ProofWithPublicValues.html)
from the pre-generated proof [`fibonacci_proof.bin`](./proofs/fibonacci_proof.bin). This is a SP1 Groth16 proof that
proves that the 20th fibonacci number is 6765.

The loaded `SP1ProofWithPublicValues` will be serialized into a `SP1ProofFixture`, and written to
[`proof-fixtures/fibonacci_fixture.bin`](./proof-fixtures/fibonacci_fixture.bin). The `SP1ProofFixture`
can easily be borsh serialized and deserialized, and can be verified on chain.

### Running the script

To load the pregenerated proof and verify it, run the following commands. 

```shell
cd script
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
```

To generate a fresh proof from the program in `sp1-program`, run the following commands. 

```shell
cd script
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --prove
```

## Overview: Solana Program

The code in [`program`](./program) is a simple Solana contract that verifies a 
`SP1ProofFixture` using the `sp1-solana` crate. It costs roughly 280,000 compute units. 

**TODO**

### Running the Solana program

Running the Solana program and tests requires the following

* [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
* [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli)
  * Make sure to install the edge version. Run the following: 
  ```shell
  sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/edge/install)"
  ```
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```shell
cd solana
pnpm install
yarn build-and-test
```
